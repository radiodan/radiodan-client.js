# Radiodan Client Library Documentation

This site hosts API documentation and example code for using the Radiodan
client library. For an explanation of the Radiodan project as a whole, please
see our [main website](http://radiodan.net).

## Getting Started

Our [minimal installation guide] [1] will quickly get you set up with
a working radio app and all the project dependencies. The rest of this
documentation assumes a working installation from that guide.
