# Radiodan Client Library Documentation

This site hosts API documentation and example code for using the Radiodan
client library. For an explanation of the Radiodan project as a whole, please
see our [main website](http://radiodan.net).

## Getting Started

Our [minimal installation guide] [1] will quickly get you set up with
a working radio app and all the project dependencies. The rest of this
documentation assumes a working installation from that guide.

## Usage Documentation

Before using the library, it would be useful to read our [general overview][2], that
expains how commands, responses and events are handled throughout the system.

The following pages help to explain the major objects in the client library:

* [Players & Playlists](usage/players-playlists.md)
* [Audio Devices](usage/audio-devices.md)
* [Physical Buttons & Interface](usage/physical-buttons-and-interface.md)
* [Connect middleware and client-side source code](usage/connect-middleware.md)

Full API documentation is available here, too.
